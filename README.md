# Dev Challenge (Short)

### The Asset Management Digital Challenge
Your task is to add functionality for a transfer of money between accounts. Transfers should be specified by providing:
 * accountFrom id
 * accountTo id
 * amount to transfer between accounts


I have added the basic functionality and added exceptions and logging for the same.
Points that can be improved on:
* Currency handling.
* Global Exception handling for other requests as well.
* Logging can be improved for the whole project.
